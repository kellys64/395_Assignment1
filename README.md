## Assignment 1: Test Driven Development
Within `fizzbuzz.py` you will find function `FizzBuzz`. On the command line, this can be tested by calling:

```
python fizzbuzz.py <input>
```
If you are working on a windows machine. The output will be "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, or "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both.

Within `password_validator.py` you will find function `pass_val`. On the command line, this can similarily be tested by calling:

```
python password_validator.py <input>
```
If you are working on a windows machine. This will expect the password to be 8 characters long, have 2 numbers, one capital letter, and one special character (i.e.: "#", "!", "_", etc). If any of these are not met, it will report an error message.

The tests can be checked by running `test.py`. Each test is printed out to make the screenshots easy to scan through.
